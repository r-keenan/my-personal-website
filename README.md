## Welcome to my website makeover!

This is my portfolio and blog that I am currently working on. The stack so far is Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Tailwind UI components. The backend is currently Node.js hosted on Vercel. The URL to see this code live is https://rosskeenan.com. 

I plan on propping up a proper backend for this site once it becomes necessary. I am handling the form client side right now, so there is not a need for a backend at this time. I will probably switch out the Blog arrays for a headless CMS in the near future.
