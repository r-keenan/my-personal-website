# Welcome to my website makeover!

This is my portfolio and blog that I am currently working on. The backend is currently Node.js hosted on Vercel. The URL to see this code live is https://rosskeenan.com.

### Tech Stack for This Project

- Next.js with TypeScript
- GitHub Actions
- Codeql
- Sanity Headless CMS
- Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind UI components
- Vitest

I plan on propping up a proper backend for this site once it becomes necessary. I am handling the form client side right now, so there is not a need for a backend at this time.

I am currently working on rewriting this from Next.js to Sveltekit with Svelte 5. You can see the progress of the project here: [My Website 2024](https://github.com/r-keenan/my-personal-website-2024)
